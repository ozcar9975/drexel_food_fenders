///target room is set in the creation code listed under "wraps > ob_warp_test_stage > creation code"
//creation code is essentially letting you set different variable values of stats for the same objects in different rooms
//For example, we can have one pink blobber that is 10 hp in room 1, while 20 in room 2
//very useful so we do not have to make like different mob for each room

//tldr: useful to set different values to same object in different places
